# ProcessResourceManager
This is a project for UC,Irvine ICS143 Project 1 (Process Resource Manager)
compiled using "g++ -g -o Shell Shell.cpp" in linux system (putty)
for some reason, the program only works with reading txt file in the same folder. (otherwise only takes first line and exit)
most error case handled as the professor asked. (still there are always error that has not been detected)
several functions are originaly designed but removed by the professors requirement
so please ignore empty functions

"report" as an input will show current state of all resource and process.
